                        <p>Hello! Thanks for taking a moment to check out my website!</p>
                        <p>I'm an aspiring full-stack developer working on their second year of self-teaching web development. I have been using Udemy courses, bootcamp material, Youtube tutorials, and <i>plenty</i> of books to reinforce the fundamentals of web development.</p>
                        <p>The reason I embarked on this journey was because I found myself at a crossroads in my life. After graduating from U.C. Berkeley with a degree in Political Science, and working with startups in a variety of roles for 4 years, I realized that I needed the sense of fulfillment that comes with a career. I wanted my work to have a meaningful impact. And as someone obsessed with technology and its socio-political impact, I decided to learn to code. Perhaps more selfishly, I admit that as a transgender person, the stability and community afforded to developers regardless of identity is a strong motivating factor.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, this portfolio exists as an example of my design and development skills. The goal is to find a team of talented engineers to take a chance and allow me to demonstrate my capabilities to design and develop great features, applications, and user experiences. Regardless of your position, I would really appreciate any feedback, comments, or mentorship you wish to give.</p>
                        <p>Thanks again for taking time to read through this, you're awesome! You can learn more about me by clicking the button below.</p>
